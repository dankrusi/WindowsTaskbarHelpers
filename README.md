# Windows Taskbar Helpers

A free utility to make the Windows 11 Taskbar just a little bit more useful by allowing you to pin quick launchers that always open a new folder, app or anything.

## The Problem

While Windows 11 is a welcome improvement in the general usability and tidyness for the Windows OS, it does have some small annoyances for power users. For many, its the way that the new taskbar works: pinned apps typically open and expand, not allowing for launching multiple copies of the app. This is specifically annoying if you want to for example pin different folders, and you would like a press on the Downloads pin to always open a new window with your Downloads.

## The Solution

This repository provides a wide series of little faux apps you can pin to your Taskbar with one promise: they will always open a new copy and will never register as open/expanded. Thus, if you add them to our Taskbar, you can create a series of shortcuts and tools. All the common apps and shortcuts for Windows are included, but you can also easily create your own.

## How it Works
